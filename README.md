# Callbacks, Promises and Async Functions
To run the app first run:   
```
npm install
```   
then to lunch the server using each pattern you could do:   
```
npm run callbacks
```   
or:    
```
npm run promises
```   
or:   
```
npm run async-await
```

## Where to start
Promises helped us with the painful experience we had with Callbacks and now Async functions allows to simply `await` on a Promise. We will cover all the three patterns with live coding to see how easy it is to write a cleaner code using async/await.

In this workshop we will be implementing CRUD using Callbacks, Promises and ES2016 async/await functions.

## What you'll learn:
How to get the most out of error-first callbacks.
The art and science of error handling when using callbacks.
How to use promises.
How Async functions could be helpful to write cleaner and more readable code.
## Perfect if you:
 - Have some experience in node.js.  
 - Have used error-first callbacks.  
 - Are slightly familiar with promises; there will be enough content provided to help you master promises.  
 - Are willing to learn how to write clean and reliable asynchronous code.  

## How to prepare:  
Anyone is welcome to join and watch, but if you'd like to code along (recommended):   
 - clone the repository, run `git checkout callbacks && npm install && npm start` and join the cloud 9 workspace at time of the workshop!
 - You could find more about promises on http://promisejs.org/.
